# Cropper

A simple GUI tool for *nix-based systems to quickly crop lots of images (sequentially). Handy for removing irrelevant/confusing parts from images before training a NN.

Select directory with images -> drag your mouse to select the cropping area -> press spacebar to crop, save, and view next photo, or re-drag a new cropping area.

### TODO
* Error catching
* Usage instructions on launch
* Tudying-up
* Windows support
